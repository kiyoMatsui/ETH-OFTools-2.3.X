# ETH-OFTools-2.3.X

This fork has taken the filtered noise inflow generator from the Chair of Building Physics (ETH Zurich) addons for OpenFOAM-2.3.x and attempts to make it compatible with the latest OpenFOAM release.
Compiles and passes basic tests on OpenFOAM-4.x.
Compiles on OpenFOAM-6.x.

just build with wmake libso :)
